## Introduction
The Company Productivity Management System is a **Java-based** application designed to help companies optimize their employees' productivity by aligning work preferences with productivity goals. Research has shown that allowing employees to work in a manner that suits their preferences, such as working from home, working late, or working early, can lead to increased productivity. This project aims to provide companies with a tool to achieve just that.

By gathering and analyzing data on employees' working preferences and productivity metrics, which are stored in a **SQL database**, the Company Productivity Management System provides insights and recommendations on how to improve productivity at both the individual and company levels. With this system, companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance workplace satisfaction and productivity.
